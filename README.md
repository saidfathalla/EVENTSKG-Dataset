# EVENTSKG-Dataset
A dataset of scientific events, containing historical data about the publications, submissions, start date, end date, location and homepage for top-prestigious events series.

  We are happy to announce a new release of EVENTSKG (formarly EVENTS). The new release is a Linked Dataset leading to richer and cleaner data. 
   A notable feature of this release is the use of the updated version of the Scientific Events Ontology (SEO) http://sda.tech/SEOontology/Documentation/SEO.html as a reference ontology for event metadata representation. 
  This release is a specification of 73 top-prestigious events series in six computer science communities. The dataset is publicly available online in three different formats (i.e. CSV, Turtle, json and RDF).
